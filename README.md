Website in progress

How to upload your podcast to the website:
1. Make sure your podcast has been uploaded to Soundcloud.
2. Upload an accompanying image file for your podcast to tuftspodcastnetwork.github.io/img/projects/
   * Make sure it has a short, but identifying name (e.g. "lit1" for Episode 1 of It's Lit)
2. Open tuftspodcastnetwork.github.io/portfolio-projects.json (click on the pencil icon to edit)
3. Press enter after line 1 to create a blank line 2, copy and paste the following code (but fill in brackets with your podcast info)
  {
    "pub" : "[NAME OF PODCAST]",
    "headline" : "[DESCRIPTION OF PODCAST]",
    "subhead" : "",
    "url" : "[COPY AND PASTE FROM SOUNDCLOUD PAGE FOR PODCAST]",
    "thumbnail" : "projects/[PODCAST IMAGE]"
  },
